## Project Sharing Platform

**Description:**
The Project Sharing Platform allows users to share their projects and links. Users can create profiles, add information about their projects, and share valuable resources. It's the perfect place to exchange ideas and get inspired by other community members. This is an educational project where I experiment with new technologies, particularly practicing TypeScript and working with Grafbase.

**Features:**
- User profile creation and customization
- Adding and managing projects
- Support for links to live sites and GitHub repositories
- Ability to search and filter projects by categories and keywords
- Public access to profiles and projects of other users

**Technologies:**
- Grafbase SDK
- TypeScript
